I am Nimrod Polido and here is my submission regarding the assessment from Bitcoin.com. This file also contains my explanation on how I used AI to complete the assignment:

I would say that the part where I used AI the most were codes regarding Jetpack Compose or the building of the UI of the app. I am familiar with Jetpack Compose, but I am still in the process of mastering it because most of the application that I am involved with are XML. I used the help AI to achieve the implementation of MVVM with Room and Dagger Hilt, since there are times that I tend to forget the structure and syntax. I also used it to help with the conversion functions that I needed like the function to convert Bitmap to Base64 and vice versa and other things as well. I have also used it when working on the testing and I also used it regarding the camera feature. There are also some issues that I encountered during the development where I needed the help of AI. Basically, AI is a big help during development process and I think most developers would agree to that. 

Thanks
